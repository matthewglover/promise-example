# Building a promise implementation


## What

An A+ Promise implementation

## How

Using ES6 and TDD

## Why

To learn about Promises and how they work.

# Requirements

- Basic callbacks: Promise.then should call resolve/reject when an async function resolves/rejects

- Synchronous callbacks: Promise.then should call resolve/reject when a sync function resolves/rejects

- Return a Promise - Promise.then should return a Promise

- Default arguments - Promise.then should use identity function if called with a non-function argument
